This project works on the creation of the adaptive bitrate algorithms.
\
To replicate this work the codes and datasets can be downloaded and run on colab platform.
\
Or it can be replicated by using the kaggle platform. 
\
For Running on kaggle follow the link : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mtp-rw/data
\ Sign in to kaggle and accept the competition rules.
\After that the notebooks will be able to use the datasets. 

The important notebooks are :
\1.Trace throughput
\2.QoE upload
\3.Buffer upload
\4.Environment + Policy PPO
